				<p> Netflix’s Maid tells the story of Alex (Margaret Qualley), who, after leaving her emotionally abusive husband, must turn to housekeeping — in other words, cleaning some disgraceful houses — in an attempt to make ends meet. During her attempts, she faces a battle against hardship, relationship difficulties, homelessness, and poverty.The limited series is itself inspired by the memoir Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother’s Will to Survive. The best-selling book told the story of battles against poverty, homelessness, and bureaucracy from Alex’s point of view, which gets very much adapted in a similar fashion for the series. </p>

				<p> Some will say Steven Soderbergh’s true-life telling of that time a single mother blew the whistle on PG&E; knowingly poisoning local residents objectifies its lead with scanty costumes. We’d say that’s precisely why this film makes our list: because women can wear whatever the hell they want and get sh*t done!  </p>

				<p>The Handmaid's Tale is the story of life in the dystopia of Gilead, a totalitarian society in what was the United States. Gilead is ruled by a fundamentalist regime that treats women as property of the state, and is faced with environmental disasters and a plummeting birth rate. In a desperate attempt to repopulate a devastated world, the few remaining fertile women are forced into sexual servitude. One of these women, Offred, is determined to survive the terrifying world she lives in, and find the daughter that was taken from her.</p>

				<p>The teen movie is an often raucous affair: embryonic sexual stirrings, combative parent/child relationships and the heart-tugging turbulence of post-adolescent friendship – which is why it is surprising to find Greta Gerwig’s directorial debut, Lady Bird, such a quiet and understated film. But there is perhaps something about Gerwig’s delicacy of touch that lends clarity to one of the film’s most resounding themes: its unapologetic feminism. The central character (Saoirse Ronan) – unsatisfied with her comparatively drab given name, Christine – precociously assumes the alias Lady Bird. She dresses in thrift-shop clothes, has clumsily dyed pink hair and dreams of leaving what she deems the cultural wasteland of Sacramento, California, and her claustrophobic Catholic high-school – to study at a pricey liberal arts college on the US east coast. Lady Bird regards neither romantic breakdown as a treatise on her general worth: how she values herself is almost entirely self-determined, a bullish sense of her potential. Teen films often reinforce the notion women can only find fulfilment via a conventional heterosexual coupling, usually advanced by the man. Lady Bird subverts that, and the film’s romantic apex is found in Lady Bird and Julie’s, her best friend, reconciliation. Maternal love is depicted with a necessary brutality: Marion perpetually chastises Lady Bird, telling her she’s unlikely to get into the east-coast college of her dreams on account of her poor work ethic and bad grades. (Lady Bird throws herself out of a moving car in response.) It is understood she is fostering in her daughter the grit and resolve required to exist in the world, a strength she vividly inhabits. And Lady Bird, with her steely sense of a right to exist and an entitlement to pursue her ambitions, seems not to have fallen too far from the tree.</p>

				<p>There may not be crying in baseball, but there is feminism. The late Penny Marshall directed this sporty wartime gem about the very first female professional baseball league. Geena Davis and Tom Hanks star as the heroine fighting the patriarchy, respectively, and as inspirational as it is just plain entertaining, it encourages female vierwers young and old to embrace unapolagetic champion stifled inside each one of us.  </p>

				<p>In Believe Me, contributors ask and answer the question: What would happen if we believed women? If we believed women about pleasure and reproduction, we would save a staggering amount of public health costs. If we believed survivors who aren't white or straight, we would strengthen our anti-rape efforts. If we believed black women when they talk about pain, we could save lives. Including contributions from Moira Donegan, Jamil Smith, Tatiana Maslany, and many more of the most important voices in feminism today, Believe Me is essential reading for the #MeToo era. </p>

				<p>Sex Object explores the painful, funny, embarrassing, and sometimes illegal moments that shaped Valenti’s adolescence and young adulthood in New York City, revealing a much shakier inner life than the confident persona she has cultivated as one of the most recognizable feminists of her generation.In the tradition of writers like Joan Didion and Mary Karr, this literary memoir is sure to shock those already familiar with Valenti’s work and enthrall those who are just finding it.</p>

				<p>Coming of age in a culture that demands women be as small, quiet, and compliant as possible--like a porcelain dove that will also have sex with you--writer and humorist Lindy West quickly discovered that she was anything but. From a painfully shy childhood in which she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her big body and even bigger opinions; to her public war with stand-up comedians over rape jokes; to her struggle to convince herself, and then the world, that fat people have value; to her accidental activism and never-ending battle royale with Internet trolls, Lindy narrates her life with a blend of humor and pathos that manages to make a trip to the abortion clinic funny and wring tears out of a story about diarrhea.With inimitable good humor, vulnerability, and boundless charm, Lindy boldly shares how to survive in a world where not all stories are created equal and not all bodies are treated with equal respect, and how to weather hatred, loneliness, harassment, and loss--and walk away laughing. Shrill provocatively dissects what it means to become self-aware the hard way, to go from wanting to be silent and invisible to earning a living defending the silenced in all caps.

				<p>Now an Emmy-winning television series, Atwood’s The Handmaid's Tale is a gold-standard of feminist speculative fiction. The story follows Offred, a member of the fertile female servant class that is forced to survive in a dystopic near-future by serving as reproductive vessels for the ruling clas. In a time when women’s reproductive rights remain politically contentious, Atwood’s seminal novel remains as pertinent now as it did when it hit shelves more than thirty years ago.</p>

			<p>The Left Hand of Darkness was among the first books in the genre now known as feminist science fiction and is the most famous examination of androgyny in science fiction.[ A major theme of the novel is the effect of sex and gender on culture and society, explored in particular through the relationship between Ai and Estraven, a Gethenian politician who trusts and helps Ai. When the book was first published, the gender theme touched off a feminist debate over the depiction of the ambisexual Gethenians. The novel also explores the interaction between the unfolding loyalties of its two main characters, the loneliness and rootlessness of Ai, and the contrast between the religions of Gethen's two major nations.</p>

			<p>Feminist blogger Jessica Valenti's bestselling book makes a powerful case that evangelical Christians, right-wing politicians, and conservative activists have been using irrational fears around young women's sexuality to undermine women's autonomy and roll back women's rights. In a wide-ranging analysis that moves from 'purity balls' and the abstinence movement to right-wing attacks on Planned Parenthood and women's reproductive health care, Valenti targets the persistent patriarchal assumption that men know what's best for women -- and that a woman's worth depends on what she does, or does not do, sexually. The result is a timely and clarifying look at the relationship between women's equality, women's sexuality, and a reactionary political movement that is working on multiple fronts to undermine both. Ideal for courses in women's studies, women's health issues, gender studies, and contemporary politics.</p>
