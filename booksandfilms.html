				<p> This 10 episode Netflix series was my favorite of 2021. The series was inspired by Stephanie Land's memoir Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother's Will to Survive. The main character, a mother and her daughter, work towards fleeing her abusive boyfriend by navigating through social services. The series brings the light the challenges to victims of domestic violence and the harships they face finding housing, support, and understanding. The exuctive producers include actress Margot Robie and John Wells. What makes this series so interesting is that the show never leaves the main characters narrative or perspective. Every scene is told through her eyes and what she hears. Although the themes are dark and challening, there are all moments of joy and small victories shown along the way. </p>

				<p class="review-quote">"A cinematic picture that is truly ahead of its time, bringing attention to an environmental crime as well as misogynistic views of the 90's. Throughout the film, there are many emotions to feel but these are the types of films that stick out the most. At the start of the film, you would not think the plot focuses on an environmental crime."- Jessica Carreto  </p>
	<p class="review-name">"Much like 2010's "Gasland" (envirnomental poisoning by fracking) and 2019's "Dark Water" (poisoning by DuPont's Teflon), "Erin Brockovich" is about whistle-blowing on Pacific Gas and Electric's groundwayer poisoning via hexavalent chronium."- Mark Jackson </p>
	<p class="review-publication">"Poweful and funny, Erin Brockovich is a must-see film that features a spellbinding, scene-stealing performance by Julia Roberts and a thrilling, well-executed portrayal of a real-life legal case."- Matthew M. Samuel </p>

				<p> This Netflix series is one of a kind, based on the best-selling novel by Margaret Atwood. It puts you inside the world of main character, Offred, who lives in the utopia of Gilead-a totalitarian society that was once part of the United States. Gilead treats women as property of the state due to a plummeting birth rate crisis. The country forces women into being handmaids, which are sex slaves to procreate for wealth husbands and wives. The series focused on Offred who is determined to survive and get her and her daughter out. The intensity of the scenes is at times hard to watch. In Atwoods Masterclass series she stated "When I wrote 'The Handmaid's Tale', nothing went into it that had not happened in real life somewhere at some time. The reason I made that rule is that I didn't want anybody saying, 'You certainly have an evil imagination, you make up all these bad things.'I didn't make them up'." </p>

This is how women around the world feel with regards to religions. I was always told "Men rule this world" and they are right. How? Through religion. Handmaid's Tale is one such show. It gives a very short story of what has been happening since the dawn of religion. "In the name of God" we kill and control. This TV show brings it all out. No holds barred.

				<p> Lady Bird is a film starring my favorite actress, Sairse Ronan, who plays a high school senior who wants nothing more than to leave her lousy hometown of Sacramento, California. With big dreams and aspirations of moving to the East Coast like New York where there's culture to re-christen herself from the drab of her current life, we also see the beautiful yet strained relationship between her and her mother.

				<p> Believe Me, is a book about what it means to belive women. With the #metoo movement came two narratives. One narrative coming from women saying this is my experience and you should believe me. The second narrative saying how am I supposed to believe every woman who says she experienced something? This novel gives a shove to the culture forefront on what it means to believe women and the authors and contributors of this books believe this means to treat women as defacto, credible AND important. The editors are Jaclyn Friedman and Jessica Valenti who are both writers, speakers and activists. Contributors include Moira Donegan, a columnist at The Guardian who covers gender and politics, Matt Lubchansky, a political cartoonist and the person behind the webcomic, Please Listen To Me, and the associate editor at The Nib.

				<p class="review-quote">"It took me four months to finally finish this book. Not because I thought it wasn't good, but because these essays were so powerful and personal that sometimes it became too much to keep going without a break. Sexual assault, rape, workplace harassment, sexism, and racism are heavy topics, but each of these writers leads a fearless charge to protect women from violence and show how the world needs to start believing their stories if we ever want to see true systemic change in our justice system, workplace, schools, and homes. This is also very timely reading for the #MeToo Movement and the Black Lives Matter Movement."- Caitlyn </p>
	<p class="review-name">"An interesting collection of essays on gender based violence and women’s place in society.

				<p class="review-quote">"West has a really engaging conversational writing style. She swears, she uses funny footnotes, she admits to some of the most embarrassing things that have ever happened to her. I imagine the latter was therapeutic and, in many ways, empowering. If you admit the most humiliating things you've ever done, if you say the most creative insults about yourself before anyone else can, what has anyone got to hold over you? While this sells itself as being about a "loud" woman, I'd say it's more about being a fat woman. Lindy West claims her fatness in this book, rejects condescending "kind" words like "big", and smashes all the arguments that concerned thin people come up with. She kind of gets to the root of something I've always wondered about, which is: why do you fucking care? This can apply to a number of things. Like, okay, you think being fat is unhealthy, or you think being gay is wrong and trans people are going to hell, but... so fucking what? Mind your own damn business! I've never understood the need people feel to impose their concern on others who have never asked for it. I also really enjoyed West's perspective on comedy and, especially, rape jokes. I'm glad she acknowledged the limitations of the "punching up" argument, and instead offered an interesting take on how a person can successfully tell a rape joke without just being a misogynistic asshole. I'm someone who feels myself getting angry when someon even says the term "rape joke" so I was surprised to find myself convinced by her argument. Overall, this is an informative, thought-provoking and actually really FUN book. West smashes the patriarchy and fatphobia, all while telling jokes about Disney movies and pop culture. It's really effective."-Emily May

				<p> The HandMaid's Tale is a dystopian novel that the TV series is based on written by Canadian author Margaret Atwood. The book was published in 1985 whereas the TV series debuted in 2017. The story takes place in the utopia of Gilead-a totalitarian society that was once part of the United States. Gilead treats women as property of the state due to a plummeting birth rate crisis. The country forces women into being handmaids, which is sexual servitude to procreate for wealth husbands and wives. While the book is not based on a true story, it was based on real events. Atwood saved newspaper clippings, laminated them, and kept them in a box to document that what she was writing about in her story had happended in real life. She didn't research any of the stories she used because there wasn't internet back then, so she kept what she came across via reading the newspaper and magazines.  </p>

				<p class="review-quote">"I’ve been moved by books in the past, many times, but I’ve never before read a book that has emotionally drained me to such a degree. This is frightening and powerful. And sometimes it only takes a single paragraph to make you realise how much so."-Sean Barrs</p>
	<p class="review-name">"Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is a tale of terror as well as a warning. The dystopian future she describes in "Gilead" which appears to be centered in Boston (due to the reference to Mass Ave and the town of Salem) is chillingly misogynistic where women are reduced to strict categories: Martha for housework and cooking, Jezebels (easy to guess, right?), Eyes, Angels (soldiers for the state), infertile Wives and potentially fertile Handmaids. It is beautifully written with lots of flashbacks of "Offred", the protagonist's name, of how things devolved into the horrors of her present. It is disturbing because it exposes the politics of reproduction and male sexuality taken to extremes of violence that are shocking and, yet, probably seemed one possible future during the Reaganite 80s when she wrote the book and now feel like the world of which Michael Pence in particular and perhaps Paul Ryan but most definitely Steve Bannon must dream. Could things so change as quickly as she describes in the book? Let us hope not. #resist"- Michael Finocchiaro
	</p>
	<p class="review-publication">"An interesting book to read right now for a couple of reasons. One, I just finished 1984 and it was very much a world like the one in 1984. Two, the storyline closely reflects the fears of the current political climate in America.
		It is hard to say that a story like this is "great" as that has a positive connotation. I was very enthralling, but terrifying at the same time. As a man, I don't think this story has as deep of an impact on me as it would if I was a woman. If you like dystopian, you must check this book out. If you are fired up by the recent election, you may want to hold off a bit . . . it will only make it worse."-Matthew</p>

			<p>The Left Hand of Darkness is a science fiction novel by renouned science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin. She tells the story of a huma who travels to a far away icebound planet that lacks sexual prejudice where gender is always fluid. The plot is the human ambassador forming a relationship and understanding between the 'alien' kind and human kind by bidging between the human world views and the views of the planet culture. The book questions gender norms and was revolutionary for its time (1969). If you are a fan of science fiction, feminist fiction or both, this is a good recommendation for you. </p>

			<p class="review-quote">"I've become rather bitter with sci-fi over the years, as it used to be my favorite genre. But you can only read so many space operas and pretentious near futures before it gets to you a little. And then you decide to give an author a go because of some weird research string you were on... and it rekindles your love of why you started reading it in the first place. LeGuin approaches sci-fi as it should be; a thought experiment. Instead of spending pages upon pages describing the minutiae of every aspect of the future, she integrates snippets of mythology, politics, and does it in a way that you don't feel is droning on. There are parts that aren't very action oriented at all, and yet, they don't drag. I have no idea how she does it and am now rather enamored with this author.
				As for the book itself, it approaches more than the simple issue of gender; it's almost zen-like, with an exploration of a duality in a whole. And the main character was the type a cranky sap like me could really relate to. Best book I've read in a long while."- Liz </p>
<p class="review-name">"The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin has a voyeuristic quality, as if a description to a studious observation. I could not help thinking that I was reading a National Geographic article about a reporter visiting Winter, or Gethen as its inhabitants know it. Many readers cannot help but comment upon the Gethenians physiological androgyny, and this is certainly a central theme of the story, but there is so much more to fascinate the reader. Le Guin has demonstrated again how she can create a science fiction fantasy novel that is both entertaining and enlightening, using the fantasy as a vehicle to explore social and psychological themes, and to state observations about our culture as metaphor. Ray Bradbury noted that to distinguish between science fiction and fantasy, fantasy is the larger genre, a mere impressionistic lens through which we can better view our world. Likewise, Philip K. Dick (Le Guin’s high school mate, though they were not then known to each other) uses his abstractions, not as a Kafka-esque absurdist portrait, but rather as shifting hyperbole to better highlight and caricaturize the real world. In this sense, Le Guin uses TLHOD to speak to us just under the surface about a great many subjects: sexuality, social mores, violence, politics, psychology, religion, and anthropology. The final scenes where the two journey across a vast wasteland of ice took this experience for the reader to another level. A thoroughly excellent book."-Lyn</p>

		<div class="composition-description">
			<p> The Purity Myth is a book written by Jessica Valenti in 2009, my favorite feminist author, about the way women and girls are overly valued for their sexuality in purity culture and the virginity movement. Valenti focuses on how promoting chastity to young girls is damaging and conducts a cultural analysis on abstience-only curriculum, purity balls, purity rings, pornography, and dives into the organizations that are sponsored to promote this toxic culture. I did not go into reading this book with an idea of how deeply engraved purity culture is in our society until after reading this book. </p>

			<p class="review-name"> REVIEWS</p>
			<p class="review-quote">"When I saw the publication date after buying this book I was a little nervous it would be extremely outdated. But I found it still relevant. If you grew up in the 90s you might remember the purity culture overload. Purity balls, purity rings, etc. I have noticed a resurgence in purity culture recently as well. She talks a lot about the political aspects of purity culture and it was very eye opening. I highly recommend this read for anyone who wants a deeper view into the evangelical obsession with virginity."- Perfect Peanut</p>
<p class="review-name">"When Elizabeth Smart spoke at John Hopkins University in 2013, she recounted the lesson of her abstinence-only sex ed course: that women were like piece of gum, and sex outside of marriage made them equivalent to a disgusting piece of chewed gum. After losing her virginity to rape, she said she felt like that piece of chewed gum, like no one could ever love her, like she was worthless.
In this book, Jessica Valenti describes and defies this lesson that women's worth is defined by their sexuality. She rejects the entire concept of virginity as an archaic method of defining a woman's property value. Maybe she comes off as too confrontational to change the mind of a staunch pro-abstinence supporter, but I think her words are exactly what women who have been victims of rape and sexual assault need to hear. I can't afford to buy a copy of this book for every one of my friends who has been sexually assaulted, but I would do so immediately if I could."- Teresa</p>
<p class="review-publication">"A little casually written for my tastes, but this book presents a clear and passionate view against America's chastity and abstinence movement. It also takes in wider context such as pornography, religion, media representations and rape culture. Recommended."-Sarah Waldron</p>
