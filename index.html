	<p> Over the years, the gender ratio of authors and film directors have made generous strides in balancing the gap. Our society has renovated itself slowly, giving women rights to their bodies, their careers and their aspirations. Women are no longer shunned behind the titles of "mommy" or "housewife". Now, they are welcome, through the feminist movement, to education and creative freedom. </p>

	<p> <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> As time has progressed, women have made their way onto the best-seller lists. Between the 50's-90's women had half the representation male writers had, outnumbering women 3 to 1. Starting in the 2000's the gap decreased and those numbers have come closer to 1 to 1. </p>
